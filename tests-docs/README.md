# Building the Test Cases' Documentation

- Shaka Scheme also uses Google Test in conjunction with Doxygen to
  produce automatic documentation from comments in the test cases.

- To build the documention, start in this directory, and then run:

    doxygen ../doxygen_config_file_tests

- The corresponding folders for the `html/` and `latex/` documentation
  should appear here.
